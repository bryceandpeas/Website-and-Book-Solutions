Codewars Kata - 8 Kyu - Return Negative

Description:

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:

make_negative(1);  # return -1
make_negative(-5); # return -5
make_negative(0);  # return 0
Notes:

The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) can't be negative, see examples above.

def make_negative( number ):
    if number == 0:
        return(number)
    elif number > 0:
        return (-(number))
    else:
        return (number)
