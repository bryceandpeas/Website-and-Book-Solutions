collections.Counter()
A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

Sample Code

>>> from collections import Counter
>>>
>>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
>>> print Counter(myList)
Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).items()
[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).keys()
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).values()
[3, 4, 4, 2, 1]

    if shoes[size] > 0:
        total_earned.append(price)
        shoes.subtract(Counter([size]))

print (sum(total_earned))


''' Without collections because this is a rubbish example of an unneccessary use of collections '''

#from collections import Counter

N = int(input())

total_earned = 0

for i in range(N):
