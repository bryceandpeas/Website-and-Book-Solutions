['this', 'is', 'a', 'string']
Joining a string is simple:

>>> a = "-".join(a)
>>> print a
this-is-a-string 
Task 
You are given a string. Split the string on a " " (space) delimiter and join using a - hyphen.

The first line contains a string consisting of space separated words.

Output Format 
Print the formatted string as explained above.
