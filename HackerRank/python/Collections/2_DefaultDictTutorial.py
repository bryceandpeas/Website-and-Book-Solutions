Hackerrank - Python -  Collections - DefaultDict Tutorial

The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but it has one difference: The value fields' data type is specified upon initialization.
For example:

from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
d['python'].append("awesome")
d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
d['python'].append("language")
for i in d.items():
    print i
This prints:

('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
('something-else', ['not relevant'])
In this challenge, you will be given  integers,  and . There are  words, which might repeat, in word group . There are  words belonging to word group . For each  words, check whether the word has appeared in group  or not. Print the indices of each occurrence of  in group . If it does not appear, print .

Constraints



Input Format
